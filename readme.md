# stencil-storybook-boilerplate

*A boilerplate template for creating fast and robust design systems for React, Remix, Next.js, Vue, Angular or Vanilla JS Application âœ¨ with Stencil and Storybook.*

Monorepo setup with *Lerna* according to the documentation
at: [stenciljs.com/output-targets](https://stenciljs.com/docs/output-targets)

For Storybook, we use the most commonly used integration for web components with Lit, Vite and TypeScript, so you
already have a basic implementation of buttons, headers etc. Lit is not required and therefore basically
optional. When writing stories for web components built with Stencil, you don't have to use it, but you can, if you
want, perform more advanced operations using the HTML tag for example.
Alternatively, Storybook can also be reinstalled with `npx storybook@latest init` with another integration-template.

## ðŸ’¡ Requirements

- Node.js 20
- Git

## ðŸš€ Setup

1. Select the compatible Node version: `nvm use`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Navigate to the core package: `cd /packages/core` and build it with: `npm run build`
4. Go to the Storybook package: `cd /packages/storybook`
    - Use `npm run storybook.run` to monitor only the stories for changes in Storybook.
    - Use `npm run storybook` to also watch for changes in the web component itself.
